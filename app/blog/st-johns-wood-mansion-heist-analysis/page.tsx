            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-black mb-6">Incident Overview</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              In December 2024, the London mansion of Hong Kong influencer Shafira Huang was targeted in a highly
              organised burglary in St John's Wood, one of the capital's most prestigious residential districts.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              A masked intruder gained entry through a bathroom window before using a blowtorch to access the property's
              safe. Within minutes, the criminal escaped with an estimated £10 million worth of jewellery, Hermès
              handbags, and £15,000 in cash. Among the items stolen were a Graff diamond ring and Chopard earrings.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Despite the presence of CCTV and alarm systems, the burglary was executed swiftly and professionally —
              suggesting hostile surveillance of the family's routine and a calculated exploitation of security gaps.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-black mb-6">Why St John's Wood is a Target for Organised Crime</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              St John's Wood is home to international celebrities, financiers, and ultra-high-net-worth families. Its
              unique profile creates an environment where criminals are incentivised to strike:
            </p>
            <ul className="text-gray-700 space-y-3 mb-8 pl-6">
              <li>
                <strong>Concentration of wealth</strong> — many properties store multimillion-pound assets.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Predictable household patterns</strong> — staff schedules, school runs, and travel plans are
                easy to monitor.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Residential blind spots</strong> — unlike commercial districts, quiet streets provide cover for
                intruders.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Perception of low resistance</strong> — even with alarms and cameras, homes without active
                protection are seen as "soft targets."
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-black mb-6">
              How a Residential Security Team Could Have Prevented This Incident
            </h2>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">24/7 On-Site Protection</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              An RST provides round-the-clock security, ensuring intruders cannot exploit windows of opportunity when
              the property appears unguarded.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Preventive Measure:</strong> Permanent coverage creates immediate deterrence — organised criminals
              are far less likely to attempt entry when a visible, professional team is present.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Protective Surveillance & Counter-Surveillance</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Residential teams conduct proactive monitoring of surrounding streets and detect hostile reconnaissance,
              such as unusual vehicles or repeat visitors.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Preventive Measure:</strong> Identifying surveillance patterns disrupts attackers before they
              attempt a break-in.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Perimeter Control & Secure Entry Points</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              An RST maintains layered security — from controlled gates to reinforced safe zones inside the residence.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Preventive Measure:</strong> Even if an outer boundary is breached, attackers face additional
              obstacles, buying crucial time for interception.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">Rapid Response & Crisis Management</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Unlike off-site monitoring services, an RST is physically present and trained to immediately intercept,
              protect residents, and coordinate with police.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              <strong>Preventive Measure:</strong> The response time shrinks from minutes to seconds, drastically
              reducing the opportunity for theft or harm.
            </p>

              Global Shield Protection's Residential Security Teams

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              At Global Shield Protection, we design bespoke Residential Security Team programmes tailored to the unique

            <ul className="text-gray-700 space-y-3 mb-6 pl-6">
              <li>
                <strong>Permanent on-site operatives</strong> trained in protective surveillance and household security
                management.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Blended human and technical solutions</strong>, combining live monitoring with physical
                presence.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Low-profile operations</strong>, allowing families to live comfortably while benefitting from
                discreet yet effective protection.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Crisis protocols</strong>, ensuring families are shielded during emergencies — from burglary
                attempts to medical incidents.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              In the case of the St John's Wood mansion heist, a dedicated RST would have made the property an
              unattractive target. Continuous presence, proactive reconnaissance, and secure protocols would likely have
              deterred or intercepted the intruder before any loss occurred.

            <ul className="text-gray-700 space-y-3 mb-8 pl-6">
              <li>
                <strong>Homes are prime targets</strong> — luxury assets stored at residential properties are just as
                vulnerable as watches or jewellery worn in public.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Alarms and cameras are not enough</strong> — determined criminals plan around static systems.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Residential Security Teams provide true protection</strong> — proactive, on-site professionals
                who close every gap.
              </li>
