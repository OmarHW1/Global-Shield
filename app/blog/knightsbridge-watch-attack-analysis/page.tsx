            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-black mb-6">Incident Overview</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              On the evening of July 10th, 2025, a 24-year-old man named Blue Stevens was fatally stabbed outside the
              Park Tower Club hotel and casino in Knightsbridge, London. The incident occurred in a high-profile luxury
              shopping area known for its proximity to Harrods and Harvey Nichols — a district that has, in recent
              years, been plagued by "Rolex Ripper" style robberies targeting individuals wearing high-value timepieces.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Witnesses reported a masked assailant approaching the victim before the fatal stabbing, with police
              investigating robbery as a possible motive. The attack was swift, targeted, and brutally efficient,
              leaving little opportunity for the victim to react.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-black mb-6">Why Knightsbridge is a Hotspot for Targeted Attacks</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Knightsbridge, like other international luxury districts such as Monaco, Dubai Marina, and Beverly Hills,
              attracts high-net-worth visitors and residents. The combination of visible wealth, predictable pedestrian
              traffic patterns, and public visibility creates an environment where:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Criminals can identify and follow potential targets for extended periods.</li>
              <li>Surveillance blind spots between shops, hotels, and transport points create ambush opportunities.</li>
              <li>
                Evening hours, especially after luxury venues close, present higher risks due to reduced foot traffic.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-black mb-6">
              How Close Protection Could Have Prevented This Incident
            </h2>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">1. Protective Surveillance & Advance Recon</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              A trained close protection operative would have conducted a route risk assessment, identifying choke
              points and vulnerable transitions (e.g., hotel entrance to vehicle).
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Preventive Measure:</strong> Operatives blend into the environment while scanning for hostile
              surveillance or potential attackers.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">2. Secure Transport Protocols</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Rather than walking unaccompanied in high-risk zones, the client would have been escorted directly from
              venue to secure vehicle.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Preventive Measure:</strong> Reduce exposure time on public streets, particularly near known
              criminal hotspots.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">3. Counter-Surveillance Detection</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Close protection teams are trained to spot telltale signs of pre-attack surveillance, such as the same
              individual shadowing movements or loitering in strategic locations.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Preventive Measure:</strong> Disrupt attacker planning before engagement.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-4">4. Rapid Response & Intervention</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              If an assailant attempted to engage, the operative's immediate goal is to shield the client, create
              distance, and neutralise the threat until law enforcement arrives.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              <strong>Preventive Measure:</strong> Time gained can mean the difference between a foiled robbery and a
              fatal encounter.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-black mb-6">
              Global Shield Protection's Approach in Similar Scenarios
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Our teams operate with a "Protect Before React" mindset, integrating:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Advance planning with intelligence-led mapping of threat zones.</li>
              <li>
                Low-profile but effective escorting, so clients maintain normal routines without sacrificing safety.
              </li>
              <li>Discreet coordination with local law enforcement in high-risk districts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              In the case of the Knightsbridge attack, these protocols could have eliminated the attacker's opportunity
              to engage, either by changing the victim's movement pattern or by intercepting suspicious behaviour early.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-black mb-6">Key Takeaways for High-Net-Worth Individuals</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>Visible wealth equals visible risk</strong> — luxury items worn in public can make you a target.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Professional security is proactive, not reactive</strong> — the best close protection operations
                make an attack impossible before it happens.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Every movement matters</strong> — from hotel exits to short walks, exposure in high-risk zones
                must be minimised.
              </li>
            </ul>
